# StraViz
This is a repo for the code I wrote for the StraViz project. It is currently frozen, not an active dev branch. 

## How to use it 

Check out the youtube video for more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6D1GLELBj0

Basically run the Xcode porject on a iPhone, choose a workout, normalize it, print the raw data to the console. Copy the JSON from xcode console to a new file run.json file and load that file into the blender script.
