# StraViz
This is a repo for the code I wrote for the StraViz project. It is currently frozen, not an active dev branch. 

## How to use it 

Check out the youtube video for more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6D1GLELBj0

You'll have to create a new Xcode project yourself with your own developer profile. Then just copy the src folder into that project. Don't forget to add the appropriate info.plist and HealthKit capabilities. 
Run the projecton a iPhone, choose a workout, normalize it, print the raw data to the console. Copy the JSON from xcode console to a new file run.json file and load that file into the blender script. 

You can load in the testRun.json file to make sure its working properly.
